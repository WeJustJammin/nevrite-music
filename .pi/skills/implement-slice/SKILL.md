# Implement Slice

Implement a single vertical slice using strict TDD: Red → Green → Refactor.

**Input**: A slice from the phase plan with acceptance criteria
**Output**: Working code across all surfaces with passing tests

---

## Shard Overview

| # | Shard | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [`implement-slice-setup`](.agents/skills/implement-slice-setup/SKILL.md) | Checks progress state, loads skills, reads slice, checks for parallel mode, writes contracts |
| 2 | [`implement-slice-tdd`](.agents/skills/implement-slice-tdd/SKILL.md) | Executes Red→Green→Refactor, validates, updates all progress tracking files |

---

## Orchestration

### Step A — Run `.agents/skills/implement-slice-setup/SKILL.md`

Checks progress state and session continuity, loads all bundled skills, reads the slice acceptance criteria, determines if parallel mode applies, and writes the contract ({{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}} schema). If parallel mode is detected, dispatches agents for the TDD cycle.

### Step B — Run `.agents/skills/implement-slice-tdd/SKILL.md`

Executes the TDD cycle (RED: write failing tests → GREEN: implement → REFACTOR: improve quality), runs full validation, handles synthesis for parallel mode, and updates all 4 progress tracking targets (slice file, phase file, index, memory).

## Quality Gate

**BLOCKING GATE** — You may NOT call `notify_user` until ALL items pass:
- [ ] All tests pass (Test Cmd from surface stack map)
- [ ] Full validation passes (Validation Cmd from surface stack map)
- [ ] All 4 progress tracking files updated (slice, phase, index, memory)
- [ ] Each tracking file verified by re-reading after edit

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion to the user:

1. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write any patterns, decisions, or blockers from this workflow to `.memory/wiki/`. If nothing to write, confirm: "No new patterns/decisions/blockers."
2. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
3. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.
