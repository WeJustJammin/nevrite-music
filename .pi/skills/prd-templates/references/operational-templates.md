## Slice Acceptance Criteria

Use when writing slice entries during `/plan-phase` Step 4:

```markdown
### Slice N: [Name]
**Size**: S/M/L
**Surfaces**: Contract, API, DB, UI

#### Tasks
- [ ] Contract: {{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}} schema for [entity] ← no tag (orchestrator handles sequentially)
- [ ] `BE` API endpoints for [entity] ← backend agent
- [ ] `FE` [entity] page and components ← frontend agent
- [ ] `QA` Integration tests for [entity] ← QA agent (runs FIRST to write failing tests, AND after BE+FE to verify)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [error condition], then [error response]
- [ ] [Performance/security criteria if applicable]

#### Dependencies
- Requires: Slice M
- Enables: Slice P
```
