# Plan Phase — Write

Identify slices from specs, order by dependency, write acceptance criteria, generate progress files, and verify bootstrap completeness.

**Prerequisite**: Pre-flight checks must pass (from `/plan-phase-preflight` or equivalent).

---

## 1. Read phase scope

Read the file at `.memory/wiki/specs/*-architecture-design.md` (phasing section) and the file at `.memory/wiki/specs/be/index.md` (which specs to include).

## 2. Identify slices (spec-anchored derivation)

For each FE spec in the phase scope:
1. Open the FE spec's `## Interaction Specification` section
2. Enumerate every distinct named user flow (e.g., "Submit entity claim form", "Search directory with filters", "View entity detail page")
3. For each user flow, identify its primary BE endpoint from the FE spec's `## Source Map`
4. Group flows into one slice only when:
   a. They share the exact same DB write (true dependency, not just same domain), OR
   b. They are a required sequence (flow B cannot be tested without flow A existing)
5. Flows that do not meet criteria (a) or (b) become individual slices

The resulting list of slices is derived from the spec, not estimated from feature names. Do not aggregate slices by domain name or by "it feels like one feature."

Estimate complexity (S/M/L) per derived slice as informational metadata only. **Do not split, merge, or drop slices to hit a complexity target.** Slice count is determined by the spec, never by an arbitrary cap.

**L-slice handling (informational)**: If a slice is estimated L, surface it in the phase plan with the L tag and a one-line note explaining why it is large (e.g., "covers 4 endpoints with shared transaction boundary"). Splitting an L slice is permitted only when the spec itself contains a natural seam (e.g., two independent BE endpoints) — never to satisfy a count target.

**Slice count is informational**: Report the total slice count in the phase plan header. Do not stop, warn, or restructure based on count alone. A phase has as many slices as the spec produces. If the count feels uncomfortable, the correct response is to verify the spec is correctly scoped to this phase, not to compress slices.

**Phase splitting** is justified only by **dependency boundaries** (e.g., "auth must ship before any auth-gated feature"), not by slice count. If two independent domains are grouped in one phase by the architecture's phasing section, that is the architecture's call, not the planner's.

**Good slice**: "User can submit an entity claim form" (one named user flow from the FE interaction spec)
**Bad slice**: "Implement entity management" (domain name, not a spec-derived user flow)

## 2.5. Spec coverage verification

After all slices are identified, verify that the slices collectively cover ALL spec content for this phase:

1. **BE endpoint coverage**: List every endpoint in every BE spec included in this phase's scope. For each endpoint, identify which slice covers it. Build a table:

| BE Endpoint | Slice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/entities` | Slice 3: Create entity | ✅ Covered |
| `GET /api/entities/:id` | — | ❌ Uncovered |

2. **FE component coverage**: List every named component in every FE spec included in this phase's scope. For each, identify which slice covers it.

3. **Resolution**: For each uncovered item:
   - Add it to an existing slice (if it's a natural fit)
   - Create a new slice for it
   - Document it as explicitly deferred to Phase N+1 with reason

**BLOCKING GATE**: Do NOT proceed to Step 3 until every BE endpoint and FE component is either assigned to a slice or explicitly deferred.

**Feature ledger update**: If `.memory/wiki/specs/feature-ledger.md` exists, read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/feature-ledger-protocol.md` and follow **Step 5 — Slice Assignment**. Map each slice to its Feature IDs and populate the Phase and Slice columns.

### 2.75. Split companion cross-reference

For each spec in the phase scope, check if its filename contains a letter suffix (e.g., `09a-`, `09b-`):

1. If a letter suffix is found, read the spec's `## Split Group` section to identify companion specs
2. If any companion spec is ALSO in the current phase scope, verify that slices which reference entities shared across the split are annotated with companion citations. Example:
   - Slice "Create message thread" cites `[BE §3.2 09a-chat-api]` and uses the `Thread` entity
   - `Thread` is listed as a shared entity with `09b-agent-flow-api`
   - → Add companion context note: "**Companion context**: `Thread` entity shared with `09b-agent-flow-api.md` — load `§ Database Schema` from companion during implementation"
3. If a companion spec is NOT in the current phase scope, add a note to the slice: "**Cross-phase dependency**: Companion `09b-agent-flow-api.md` is in Phase N+1 — shared entity `Thread` must remain backward-compatible"

This step prevents implementation from producing incompatible data shapes across split domain boundaries.

## 3. Order by dependency

Read .agents/skills/concise-planning/SKILL.md and follow its methodology.

Sort slices so each builds on the last:
- Infrastructure slices first (DB schema, auth middleware)

**Phase 1 special rule**: Before applying this rule, read the surface stack map from `.agents/instructions/tech-stack.md` and verify that the **CI/CD** and **Hosting** cross-cutting categories have filled values. If empty, emit a **HARD STOP**: these are filled by `/create-prd-stack` — run it first.

The `00-infrastructure` shard is always the first slice. It covers only **TDD-able application code**: (1) health check endpoint, (2) error handling middleware with structured error responses, (3) logging middleware, (4) structured response envelope, (5) auth middleware stubs (BOUNDARY if auth spec not yet written). Operational setup (CI/CD, hosting, database provisioning, project scaffolding) is handled by `/setup-workspace` which runs before any `/implement-slice`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `/setup-workspace` MUST be run and pass `/verify-infrastructure` BEFORE the first `/implement-slice`. If the workspace has not been set up, emit a **HARD STOP**: "Run `/setup-workspace` first — operational infrastructure must be in place before any TDD slice."

**Verification gates** (hard gates — add explicitly to the phase plan):
- `/verify-infrastructure` MUST pass after `/setup-workspace`, before any implementation slice.
- `/verify-infrastructure` MUST pass after the infrastructure code slice, before any feature slice.
- `/verify-infrastructure` MUST pass again after the auth slice (with auth smoke test), before any auth-dependent feature slice.

- Core entity CRUD second
- Dependent features next
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, error handling) woven throughout

**Note:** This ordering is about dependencies, not about deferring quality.
Every slice — including the first infrastructure slice — is fully tested,
fully specified, and production-ready.

## 4. Write acceptance criteria

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/operational-templates.md` for the **Slice Acceptance Criteria** template. For each slice, use the template to define testable acceptance criteria with surface tags:

**Spec citation requirement**: Every acceptance criterion MUST include a spec source citation. Format: `[BE §section.subsection]`, `[FE §ComponentName]`, or `[IA §NN.EdgeCase.N]`. This ensures no criterion is invented without a traceable spec source. If a criterion cannot be traced to a spec → either the spec is incomplete (fix the spec first) or the criterion is speculative (remove it).

> **Write as you go**: After completing acceptance criteria for each slice, immediately append that slice's entry to `.memory/wiki/specs/phases/phase-N-draft.md` (create the file if it doesn't exist). Do not accumulate all slices in context and write them all at once in Step 5.

**Surface tag rules:**
- `BE`: API routes, DB queries, middleware, business logic, server-side validation
- `FE`: Pages, components, styling, interactions, client-side logic
- `QA`: Test writing (RED phase — runs FIRST), test verification (GREEN phase — runs LAST)
- No tag: Contract/schema work, shared infra — handled sequentially by orchestrator

## 4.4. Slice depth floor (mandatory — derived from spec)

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/slice-depth-floor.md` in full. For every slice, compute the **minimum acceptance-criteria count** using the formula in that file. Annotate the slice in `phase-N-draft.md` with the computed floor and its breakdown.

**Hard gate**:
1. The acceptance-criteria count written in Step 4 MUST equal or exceed the computed floor for every slice. If it does not, return to Step 4 and add the missing criteria — every missing criterion must trace to a concrete spec item (validation rule, error code, role, state, edge case) that the slice covers.
2. Apply the **Spec Thinness Detection** table from `slice-depth-floor.md`. If any slice's referenced spec section produces zero items in a required category, **STOP**. Do not write shallow criteria from a thin spec. Tell the user: "Spec [BE/FE/IA §...] is too thin to produce a meaningful slice. Run `/resolve-ambiguity [path]` before continuing." Wait for the spec to be deepened, then re-run this step.

The floor is the **minimum**, not the maximum. Implementers may add criteria beyond the floor; they may not write fewer.

This step exists to prevent shallow slices from being green-lit by the criteria-counting gate. Without it, a slice can be planned with 3 criteria when its specs collectively define 18 items that need explicit verification.

## 4.5. Identify parallel groups (TDD order)

Read `.agents/skills/parallel-agents/SKILL.md` and follow its TDD-Order Dispatch methodology for parallel groups and execution order. Flag any tasks that can't be parallelized (shared file dependencies) in the plan.

## 5. Finalize phase plan

Read `.memory/wiki/specs/phases/phase-N-draft.md` (which was built progressively in Step 4) and write the final formatted phase plan to `.memory/wiki/specs/phases/phase-N.md`. The draft is the authoritative source — do not add or drop slices during finalization.

## 6. Generate progress files

Read `.agents/skills/session-continuity/protocols/02-progress-generation.md` and follow the **Progress Generation Protocol** to create tracking files for this phase in `.memory/pipeline/progress/`.

## 6.5. Bootstrap Completeness Gate

Scan these four files for literal `{{` occurrences of `LANGUAGE_SKILL`, `HOSTING_SKILL`, `CI_CD_SKILL`, `ORM_SKILL`, `UNIT_TESTING_SKILL`, `E2E_TESTING_SKILL`:

> **Note**: As of v3, these files no longer contain literal `{{` placeholders — they reference the surface stack map. This gate now verifies that the surface stack map itself is fully populated for all surfaces involved in this phase.

Read the surface stack map from `.agents/instructions/tech-stack.md`. Verify all per-surface and cross-cutting cells are filled. Verify `.agents/instructions/commands.md` has non-template values.

> ❌ STOP — Only proceed to Step 7 when the map is fully populated. If any cells are empty after bootstrap, tell the user which cells could not be provisioned.

## 7. Refresh graph, request review, and next steps

1. Call `memory_compile` after finalizing the phase artifacts so graph/hubs reflect the latest planning state.
2. Verify the compile succeeded before presenting completion.
3. Use `notify_user` to request review of the phase plan and generated progress files, including graph refresh confirmation.

**STOP** — do NOT proceed until the user explicitly approves the phase plan. The only valid next step after approval is `/implement-slice` for the first slice. Read `.memory/pipeline/progress/` to identify which slice to start with.
