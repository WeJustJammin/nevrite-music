# Create PRD — Architecture & Data Strategy

Design the high-level system architecture and data strategy. Create the data placement strategy document.

---

## 0. Map guard

Follow the map guard protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/map-guard-protocol.md`). Required cells for this shard:

| Map Location | Column/Category | Why this matters |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-Cutting | Hosting | Deployment topology (Step 4.3) needs hosting-specific conventions. |
| Per-Surface (shared) | ORMs | Migration strategy (Step 5.4) needs ORM-specific schema conventions. |
| Per-Surface (shared) | Databases | Data strategy (Step 5) needs database-specific schema design patterns. |

**HARD GATE** — If ANY required cell is empty → STOP. No timing fallbacks. No conversation-confirmed values. See map guard protocol for recovery.

Read the engagement tier protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/engagement-tier-protocol.md`) — apply the tier behavior for architecture decisions.

---

## 0.5. Ideation context reload

> **This step is mandatory.** Shards run in separate conversations — ideation context from the orchestrator is lost. Reload it here.

1. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md` — extract: Structure Map (domain list + paths), MoSCoW Summary (full feature inventory), Engagement Tier, persona list
2. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/meta/constraints.md` — extract: Project Surfaces, compliance constraints, hard/soft constraints
3. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-cx.md` (global cross-cuts) — extract: cross-domain data dependencies, trigger chains, shared entity ownership. Then read each domain-level `{domain}-cx.md` listed in the Structure Map
4. If `## Ideation Digest` exists in `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` → use it as the structured feature inventory. Otherwise, read domain index files (`{domain}/{domain}-index.md`) directly per the deep ideation loading protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/deep-ideation-loading-protocol.md`)

**How this context feeds downstream steps:**
- Component diagram (4.1) ← domain boundaries from domain indexes, trigger chains from CX files
- Data flow (4.2) ← cross-domain dependencies from CX files, persona access from role matrices
- Data strategy (5) ← key entities from domain children tables, shared entities from CX
- Data placement (5.1) ← surface constraints from constraints.md

> ❌ Do NOT proceed to Step 4 until all ideation context is loaded. Do NOT rely solely on architecture-draft.md — it is the agent's prior output, not the user's ideation.

### Checkpoint resumption

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/workflow-checkpoint-protocol.md`. Check if `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md` exists. If it exists and `active_shard` matches this file → follow the resumption procedure. If not → initialize a fresh checkpoint.

---

## 4. System architecture

Read `.agents/skills/api-design-principles/SKILL.md` for API surface design.

Design the high-level system. Each sub-item requires full exploration, not a summary sentence:

1. **Component diagram** — What services exist? How do they communicate? What protocols? What happens if one is down?
2. **Data flow** — Request lifecycle from client to database and back. Every hop, every transformation, every auth check along the way. Draw the full sequence.
3. **Deployment topology** — What runs where? Edge? Origin? External? Local machine? App Store? What are the latency implications? What are the cost implications?
   Load the Hosting skill(s) from the cross-cutting section per the skill loading protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/skill-loading-protocol.md`).
   Read .agents/skills/technical-writer/SKILL.md and follow its methodology.
4. **API surface** — REST? GraphQL? RPC? Versioning strategy? Error format? Pagination? Rate limit headers?
5. **Deployment strategy** — Rolling? Blue-green? Canary? Read `.agents/skills/deployment-procedures/SKILL.md` Section 6 for the strategy options and selection matrix. Ask:
   - "Which zero-downtime deployment strategy fits your risk profile? Rolling (standard), Blue-Green (easy rollback), or Canary (validate with real traffic)?"
   - "Do you want feature flags for controlled rollout of risky features? If yes, which provider (or build your own)?"
   - "What is your rollback trigger? Error rate spike above N%? Latency threshold? Manual decision?"
   Write the confirmed strategy to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` under `## Deployment Strategy`.

For multi-surface projects, additionally define:
6. **Surface interconnection** — How do surfaces communicate? What is the source of truth for shared data? What happens when a surface is offline?
7. **Shared domain boundary** — Which entities/models are shared across surfaces vs surface-specific?

For each component, also define:
- What it owns (data, logic, auth decisions)
- What it delegates (to other components or external services)
- What happens when it fails (graceful degradation, circuit breakers, fallbacks)

**Present to user**: Show the system architecture section and walk through each component. Ask:
- "Does this component diagram capture every service in the system?"
- "Are there failure modes I haven't accounted for?"
- For multi-surface: "What happens if the sync layer goes down? Can each surface degrade gracefully?"

Follow the decision confirmation protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/decision-confirmation-protocol.md`) — do not write until explicitly confirmed.

Write the completed `## System Architecture` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` (create the file if it does not exist). Do not wait until the end — write this section as soon as it is completed and confirmed by the user. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

> **Decision recording**: For each non-trivial architecture decision (technology choices, deployment topology, API style, failure handling strategy), read `.agents/skills/session-continuity/protocols/06-decision-analysis.md` and follow the **Decision Effect Analysis Protocol**. Architecture decisions have the highest downstream impact in the pipeline — record them to `.memory/wiki/decisions.md` with the Philosopher + Devil's Advocate deliberation.

## 4.5. Error architecture

> **Hard gate.** This step is mandatory for every project. All five decisions below must be confirmed by the user before `## 5. Data strategy` begins. Do not proceed to Data Strategy until every decision is explicitly approved.

Read `.agents/skills/error-handling-patterns/SKILL.md` and follow its Error Architecture Interview methodology. All 5 decisions must receive explicit user confirmation before proceeding to Data Strategy. This step is a hard gate — do not proceed until all five decisions are confirmed.

Write the completed decisions to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` under a new top-level `## Error Architecture` section (between `## System Architecture` and `## Data Strategy`). The section must contain five sub-sections matching the five decisions above (`### Global Error Envelope`, `### Error Propagation Chain`, `### Unhandled Exception Strategy`, `### Client Fallback Contract`, `### Error Boundary Strategy`), with the locked canonical JSON example included verbatim under `### Global Error Envelope`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

## 5. Data strategy

Read .agents/skills/database-schema-design/SKILL.md and follow its schema design methodology.

**Digest-aware entity identification**: If `## Ideation Digest` exists in `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md`, use its Key Entities column and Cross-Domain Dependencies table as the primary source for entity identification in sub-steps below. Cross-reference the digest's per-domain feature lists to ensure no entity is missed. If the digest does not exist, derive entities from the architecture sections written above.

Load the Databases skill(s) from the `shared` surface row per the skill loading protocol. Each sub-item must be explored to field-level depth:

1. **Data placement** — What lives in the database vs cache vs object storage vs external service vs local device storage? For each entity: which service owns it and why
2. **Schema approach** — Strict schema vs schemaless vs hybrid? Field types, constraints, indexes, relations with cardinality
3. **Query patterns** — Read-heavy? Write-heavy? What are the hot paths? What needs caching? What are the N+1 risks?
4. **Migration strategy** — How will schema evolve? Backward compatibility approach? Zero-downtime migration plan?
   Load the ORMs skill(s) from the `shared` surface row per the skill loading protocol.
5. **PII boundaries** — Which fields contain PII? Where is PII stored vs where is it NOT stored? How is PII isolated from AI/analytics pipelines?

For multi-surface projects, additionally define:
6. **Data ownership** — Which surface is the source of truth for each entity? How are conflicts resolved?
7. **Sync protocol** — What data syncs between surfaces? How frequently? What happens during network partition?

**Present to user**: Show the data strategy section and walk through placement decisions. Ask:
- "Does every entity have a clear owner?"
- "Are there query patterns I'm missing that could become hot paths?"

Follow the decision confirmation protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/decision-confirmation-protocol.md`) — do not write until explicitly confirmed.

Write the completed `## Data Strategy` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

### 5.5. Cross-Store Entity Consistency

Read .agents/skills/database-schema-design/SKILL.md and follow its Cross-Store Entity Consistency Protocol for every entity that spans more than one store.

Write the completed cross-store consistency table to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` as part of the `## Data Strategy` section. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

### Data placement strategy document

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/data-placement-template.md` for the template structure. Create `.memory/wiki/specs/data-placement-strategy.md` using the template, filling each section with the data decisions confirmed above.

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion or proceeding to next shard:

1. **Update checkpoint** — Write final state to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md`: mark all architecture sections complete.
2. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write patterns, decisions, or blockers to `.memory/wiki/`. Architecture decisions have highest downstream impact — every confirmed decision should have a `DEC-NNN` entry.
3. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
4. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.

---

### Next step

**STOP** — do NOT proceed to any other workflow. The only valid next step is `/create-prd-security`.

> If invoked standalone, surface via `notify_user` and wait for user confirmation.
