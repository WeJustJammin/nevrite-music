# Evolve Contract

Safely modify a {{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}} schema without breaking existing consumers.

**Input**: The contract to change and the desired modification
**Output**: Updated contract, migration tests, and all consumers updated

### When to use `/evolve-contract`

| Use `/evolve-contract` | Just edit the schema directly |
|---|---|
| The schema has **2+ consumers** across different surfaces | The schema is used in only one place |
| The change is **breaking** (rename, remove, type change) | The change is purely additive (new optional field, no consumers affected) |
| The schema is a **shared contract** (API request/response boundary) | The schema is an internal type with no cross-surface consumers |
| You need a **migration path** for existing data | No stored data uses this schema |

### When NOT to use it

- **During initial implementation** (first time writing the contract) — contracts evolve only after they exist
- **For test-only types** — internal test fixtures don't need migration safeguards
- **When `/propagate-decision` is more appropriate** — if the change originates from a locked pipeline decision (architecture, spec), use `/propagate-decision` first, then `/evolve-contract` for the schema specifically

## 0. Load contract evolution skills

Read these skills for safe schema migration:
1. `.agents/skills/migration-management/SKILL.md` — Migration strategy and versioning
2. `.agents/skills/testing-strategist/SKILL.md` — Migration test coverage
3. `.agents/skills/error-handling-patterns/SKILL.md` — follow its methodology for schema change error handling

---

## 1. Identify the contract

Determine which surface this contract belongs to (from the file path or calling context). Load the Languages skill(s) from that surface's row per the skill loading protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/skill-loading-protocol.md`).

Determine which {{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}} schema needs to change and what the change is:
- **Additive** (new optional field) — Low risk
- **Narrowing** (tighter validation) — Medium risk
- **Breaking** (rename, remove, type change) — High risk

## 2. Find all consumers

Search for all usages of `SchemaName` in the source directory (see `.agents/instructions/structure.md` for the root — typically `src/`).

Document all consumers:
- API endpoint handlers
- Frontend components
- Test files
- Other contracts that reference this one

**Zero-consumer path**: If no consumers are found (only the schema definition itself):
- Confirm with user: "Contract [name] has zero consumers. It can be modified directly without migration safeguards. Proceed with simple edit?"
- If confirmed → skip Steps 3-5, apply the schema change directly, run validation (Step 6), then proceed to Step 6.5.
- If user declines → proceed normally (the contract may have planned but not-yet-implemented consumers).

### 2.5. API versioning check (conditional)

If any consumer is a **public-facing API endpoint** (i.e., called by external clients, not just internal frontend):

Read .agents/skills/api-versioning/SKILL.md and follow its breaking change classification methodology.

Determine whether the schema change requires:
1. **In-place migration** — additive or narrowing change, no version bump needed
2. **New API version** — breaking change to a public contract, requires versioning strategy

If a new API version is needed, document the versioning approach (URL prefix, header, or query param) before proceeding to Step 3. The migration tests must validate both the old and new versions.

## 3. Write migration tests

Read .agents/skills/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md and follow its Red→Green→Refactor cycle for contract evolution.

Load the Unit Tests skill(s) from this contract's surface row per the skill loading protocol.

Before changing anything, write tests that validate:
- Existing data still passes the new schema (backward compatibility)
- New data shape is accepted
- Invalid data is rejected

Run the Test Cmd from this contract's surface row in the surface stack map (see `.agents/instructions/tech-stack.md`) — tests should FAIL until the schema is updated.

## 4. Update the contract

Load the Languages skill(s) from this contract's surface row per the skill loading protocol.

Modify the {{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}} schema. For breaking changes:
- Consider versioning (v1 → v2)
- Add runtime migration helpers if needed

## 4.5. New dependency check

If the contract change introduces a dependency not currently in the skill set — for example, a new validation library plugin, a schema extension, a binary serialization library, or a new validation pattern — read `.agents/skills/bootstrap-agents/SKILL.md` and invoke `/bootstrap-agents NEW_DEPENDENCY=[package]` before updating consumers in Step 5. **HARD GATE**: Follow the bootstrap verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/bootstrap-verification-protocol.md`).

If no new dependency was introduced, proceed directly to Step 5.

## 5. Update all consumers

Load the Languages skill(s) from this contract's surface row per the skill loading protocol.

For each consumer found in Step 2:
- Update the code to use the new schema shape
- Verify types resolve correctly

## 6. Validate

Run the Validation Cmd from this contract's surface row in the surface stack map (see `.agents/instructions/tech-stack.md` and `.agents/instructions/commands.md`).

All must pass.

## 6.5 — Spec cascade check

For each consumer updated in Step 5, identify which BE spec and FE spec reference this contract. Check whether the change (additive/narrowing/breaking) requires updating those specs. For breaking changes, the BE spec and FE spec MUST be updated before proceeding. For additive changes, update the spec if the new field is user-visible or API-facing. Update the IA Source Map in the BE spec to reflect the change.

## 7. Document the change and next steps

Add an entry to the decisions log in `.memory/wiki/specs/*-architecture-design.md` explaining why the contract changed.

**Proposed next step**: Re-run `/validate-phase` for the affected phase to ensure no regressions were introduced by the contract evolution.
