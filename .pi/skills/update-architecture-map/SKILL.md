# Update Architecture Map

This workflow scans the current state of the repository and produces a "living" map of its architecture. It should be run periodically or at the end of a major phase to ensure `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` accurately reflects the codebase.

---

**Prerequisite**: Verify that `/validate-phase` passed for the current phase before updating the architecture map. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/audits/phase-N-validation.md` (where N is the current phase number) and confirm the verdict is PASS. If the phase has not been validated or the verdict is FAIL → **STOP**: "Run `/validate-phase` for Phase N and ensure it passes before updating the architecture map."

## 0. Load architecture mapping skill

Read the skill before proceeding:
1. `.agents/skills/architecture-mapping/SKILL.md` — Defines how to perform the mapping.

## 1. File Reconnaissance & Deep Reading

Read .agents/skills/architecture-mapping/SKILL.md and follow its file reconnaissance methodology.

Analyze the project structure using file exploration tools. Do not just stop at finding directories; you must read the source code.
1. Identify core directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `api/`, etc.)
2. Use `view_file` to read the exact contents of entry points (e.g., `src/api/worker.ts`, `src/pages/index.astro`).
3. Locate and read configuration files (`package.json`, `astro.config.mjs`, `wrangler.toml`).

## 2. Component & Schema Analysis

Read .agents/skills/architecture-mapping/SKILL.md and follow its component analysis methodology.

Group files logically into components, but extract their exact contracts:
- Use `grep_search` to find contract/validation schema definitions. Search for patterns appropriate to the project's contract library (e.g., `z.object` for Zod, `BaseModel` for Pydantic, `Joi.object` for Joi, `schema(` for Yup, `struct` for Rust/Go, or `interface`/`type` definitions for TypeScript). Check `.agents/instructions/tech-stack.md` for the project's confirmed contract library if unsure.
- Document exact schema names, required environment variables, and binding names (e.g., KV namespaces, R2 buckets).

## 3. Map Explicit Data Flow and Relationships

Read .agents/skills/architecture-mapping/SKILL.md and follow its data flow mapping methodology.

Trace exactly how data moves through the system.
- Read database clients or query files to see exactly how state is managed (e.g., SurrealDB queries, Firebase Auth hooks).
- Document exact API routes, rate limiting logic, and CORS constraints present in the code.

## 4. Extract Key Patterns with Evidence

Read .agents/skills/architecture-mapping/SKILL.md and follow its pattern extraction methodology.

Identify recurring architectural patterns used in the codebase (e.g., CFPA, React Islands, utility-first CSS). 
- Provide exact file paths that prove these patterns are in use (e.g., "React Islands are used in `src/components/Header.tsx` via the `client:load` directive").

## 5. Write/Update Document

Create or update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- If it doesn't exist, create it using the structure outlined in the `architecture-mapping` skill.
- If it exists, integrate your new findings holistically. Do not just append to the end. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp.

Ensure the document is human-readable, well-structured, and focuses on high-level system interactions rather than low-level functional documentation.

## 6. Phase completion gate

Read `.memory/wiki/specs/*-architecture-design.md` → **Phasing** section to determine the total number of planned phases.
Read `.memory/pipeline/progress/index.md` to determine the current phase number N and how many phases have `status: complete`.

### If completed phases < total phases

The pipeline has more phases to implement. Present:

> "Architecture map updated for Phase N. **Next**: Run `/plan-phase` for Phase [N+1]."

### If completed phases = total phases

All phases are complete. The pipeline has reached its terminal state. Present:

> "✅ **All phases complete.** Architecture map updated. The project is ready for deployment.
>
> - Refer to `.memory/wiki/specs/ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` for deployment procedures
> - Refer to your CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated deployment
> - Run `/validate-phase` for the final phase if not already done
>
> No further `/plan-phase` iterations are needed."

**Do NOT propose `/plan-phase` after the final phase.** The loop terminates here.
