# Plan Phase

Break a phase into TDD vertical slices, each spanning all four surfaces (contract, test, implementation, UI).

> **Every slice ships production-grade code.** Slices are ordered by dependency,
> not by quality tier. The first slice and the last slice meet the same bar.

**Input**: Approved specs (IA + BE + FE) and the phasing section from architecture design
**Output**: Phase plan with ordered slices and acceptance criteria

**Prerequisite**: Approved specs across all three layers must exist. Verify:
1. `.memory/wiki/specs/ia/index.md` exists and all shards show ✅
2. `.memory/wiki/specs/be/index.md` exists and all specs show ✅
3. `.memory/wiki/specs/fe/index.md` exists and all specs show ✅

If any index is missing or contains incomplete specs → **STOP**: "Spec layers are not complete. Run `/write-architecture-spec`, `/write-be-spec`, and/or `/write-fe-spec` to complete all specs before planning a phase."

## Shard 1: Pre-flight — `/plan-phase-preflight`

Phase sequencing gate, skill loading, completeness audit, cross-layer consistency check, and draft continuity.

Run `.agents/skills/plan-phase-preflight/SKILL.md`.

---

## Shard 2: Write — `/plan-phase-write`

Slice identification, dependency ordering, acceptance criteria, progress file generation, and bootstrap completeness gate.

Run `.agents/skills/plan-phase-write/SKILL.md`.

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion to the user:

1. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write any patterns, decisions, or blockers from this workflow to `.memory/wiki/`. If nothing to write, confirm: "No new patterns/decisions/blockers."
2. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
3. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.
