# Create PRD — Design System Decisions

Establish the structural UI architecture — navigation paradigm, layout grid, page archetypes, global component inventory, motion language, data density philosophy, and global state design language. Produces `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md` which all FE specs must consume.

**Prerequisite**: Tech stack decisions must be locked (`/create-prd-stack` completed). Design context must exist — run `/impeccable teach` first to establish PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md, then verify `.agents/skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md` has no `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values.

---

## 0. Prerequisite check

### 0.1 Load impeccable context

1. Run `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/load-context.mjs` to load PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md.
2. If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder → **stop** and tell the user: _"Design context hasn't been established yet. Run `/impeccable teach` first to define the product's users, brand, tone, and design principles."_
3. Extract from the context: brand register (brand vs product), design direction, color palette (OKLCH or hex), typography, motion philosophy, spatial principles.

### 0.2 Verify pipeline placeholders

4. Read `.agents/skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md`.
5. Scan for any `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values that are still unfilled. If any exist → **stop** and tell the user: _"Design direction hasn't been confirmed yet. Run `/create-prd-stack` first to establish the design direction before designing the system."_
6. If all placeholders are filled → extract and store for this session: the confirmed `DESIGN_DIRECTION`, color palette, typography choices, motion philosophy, and anti-patterns.

### 0.3 Source material

Read `## Engagement Tier` from `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md`.

Read the engagement tier protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/engagement-tier-protocol.md`) — apply the tier behavior for design system decisions (all 7 decisions are product decisions).

1. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/meta/constraints.md` — extract the **Project Surfaces** section. Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md` — extract the feature inventory from the MoSCoW Summary.
2. Read `.agents/skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md` — extract the confirmed `DESIGN_DIRECTION`.
Read `.agents/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` — for the shared design laws (color, typography, motion, spatial) and the full command reference.
4. Read `.agents/skills/technical-writer/SKILL.md` — for document writing conventions.
5. Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/design-system-decisions.md` — all decision option menus and the output template for `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`.
6. Note which surfaces are in scope from `## Project Surfaces`.

### Ideation workflow context

> **Mandatory.** Navigation paradigms and page archetypes must be driven by actual user workflows, not abstract feature lists.

7. Read the `## Structure Map` in `ideation-index.md` — identify the **3 heaviest domains** (highest feature count / deepest nesting)
8. For each heavy domain: read `{domain}/{domain}-index.md` — extract the Children table to understand the user-facing workflows (what screens exist, what data users interact with, what actions they take)
9. If any heavy domain has deep dives → read EVERY deep dive file — extract workflow complexity, interaction patterns, data density, real-time requirements, and multi-step user flows that affect navigation and archetype decisions
10. Read CX files (`ideation-cx.md` + domain CX) — extract cross-domain navigation patterns, shared UI components, and workflow transitions between domains

> ❌ **STOP gate**: If you have not read at least one deep dive file or domain index beyond `ideation-index.md`, you are not ready to make design system decisions. `ideation-index.md` gives you feature names — the domain files give you the workflows those features represent.

### Checkpoint resumption

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/workflow-checkpoint-protocol.md`. Check if `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md` exists. If it exists and `active_shard` matches this file → follow the resumption procedure (skip completed decisions, resume from `next_action`). If not → initialize a fresh checkpoint.

### Per-decision Ideation Synthesis requirement

Before presenting **each** of the 7 design system decisions below, write a brief **Ideation Synthesis** (2-4 bullets) explaining how the ideation content informs THIS specific decision. Each bullet must cite a specific file. **Append each synthesis as a `## {Decision Name}` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/design-system-synthesis.md`.**

**Cite-or-Stop Gate**: Your synthesis must contain ≥ 1 project-specific finding with a file citation per decision.  Generic reasoning like "this is a complex app, so sidebar navigation" without citing which domains/workflows make it complex → **STOP** and re-read the heavy domain files.

---

## 2. Decision 1 — Navigation paradigm

Present surface-appropriate options from the **Navigation Paradigm Options** section of `design-system-decisions.md`. Present only the options for surfaces in scope. Include tradeoff framing — e.g., sidebar is good for complex apps with deep IA but bad for mobile-first or content-focused sites.

> **Decision prompt**: "Which navigation pattern fits your app's usage pattern and audience?"

**Tier-aware confirmation** *(applies to all 7 decisions in this shard)*:
- **Interactive/Hybrid** → "Wait for explicit user confirmation" means present and wait.
- **Auto** → auto-confirm with Deep Think reasoning. Write the decision with `[AUTO-CONFIRMED]` tag. The Auto Tier Review Checkpoint in `/ideate-validate` or the review in Step 9 is where the user can override.

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding** *(Interactive/Hybrid)* or auto-confirm with Deep Think *(Auto)*.

On confirmation, write the `## Navigation Paradigm` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md` immediately. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 3. Decision 2 — Layout grid

Ask the user about grid structure per breakpoint (mobile ≤768px, tablet 769–1024px, desktop ≥1025px): columns, gutter, max content width, grid type (CSS Grid / Flexbox / Hybrid).

Provide a **default recommendation** based on the confirmed design direction:
- Information-dense → 12-column, 24px gutter, 1440px max
- Editorial/spacious → 12-column, 32px gutter, 1200px max
- Mobile-first → 4/8/12 column progression, 16px gutter

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Layout Grid` table to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 4. Decision 3 — Page archetypes

Based on the feature inventory from `ideation-index.md`, propose a named archetype set using the **Page Archetype Options** from `design-system-decisions.md` as a starting point. Each archetype defines named layout zones. For each proposed archetype, produce a layout zones line (pipe-separated) and optionally an ASCII wireframe.

Present the proposed archetypes to the user. Ask whether any are missing or should be renamed. **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Page Archetypes` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 5. Decision 4 — Component hierarchy

Derive the global component list from the confirmed navigation paradigm and page archetypes. Use the **Global Component Categories** from `design-system-decisions.md` as a seed. Global components are those used across multiple archetypes or present on every page.

Present the derived list. Ask: (1) Are any components missing? (2) Should any be feature-local instead of global? (3) Are there project-specific components not covered?

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Global Component Inventory` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`). This serves as the **Component Inventory Seed** — all FE specs must consume (not re-invent) these global components.

---

## 6. Decision 5 — Motion language

Present the options from the **Motion Language Options** in `design-system-decisions.md`. Present a recommendation based on the confirmed design direction. **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Motion Language` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 7. Decision 6 — Data density philosophy

Present the options from the **Data Density Options** in `design-system-decisions.md`. If **Hybrid** is selected, ask the user to define per-archetype density rules. **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Data Density Philosophy` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 8. Decision 7 — Global state design language

Two-part decision. Present the loading state, error state, and empty state options from the **Global State Design Language Options** in `design-system-decisions.md`. Present recommendations based on the confirmed design direction. **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.**

On confirmation, write the `## Global State Design Language` section to `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md`. Follow the write verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/write-verification-protocol.md`).

---

## 9. Write and verify design-system.md

After all seven decisions, verify that `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md` was written progressively and is complete. Use the **design-system.md Output Template** from `design-system-decisions.md` as the canonical structure.

Verify:
1. All seven sections are present and filled (no placeholders, no TBDs).
2. The **Global Component Inventory** serves as the Component Inventory Seed.
3. Every decision references the confirmed design direction for rationale consistency.

If any section is incomplete, loop back to the relevant decision step and resolve with the user.

**Completeness loop guard**: If the same section fails completeness 2 times → **STOP**: present the incomplete section to the user with what's missing and ask: "Provide the missing content directly, or accept this section as-is with a note?"

---

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion or proceeding to next shard:

1. **Update checkpoint** — Write final state to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md`: mark all 7 decisions complete, set `current_step: completion`.
2. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write patterns, decisions, or blockers to `.memory/wiki/`. All 7 design system decisions should have `DEC-NNN` entries. If nothing to write, confirm: "No new patterns/decisions/blockers."
3. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
4. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.

---

### Next step

**STOP** — do NOT proceed to any other workflow. The only valid next step is `/create-prd-architecture`.

> If invoked standalone, surface via `notify_user` and wait for user confirmation.
