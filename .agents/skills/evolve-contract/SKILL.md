## Overview


## Step-by-Step

1. Load migration/testing/error-handling skills.
2. Identify contract and classify change risk (additive/narrowing/breaking).
3. Discover all consumers.
4. Run API versioning check when public API consumers are affected.
5. Write migration tests (RED first).
6. Update contract and consumers.
7. Validate with project commands.
8. Run spec cascade check for BE/FE/IA references.
9. Record decision/update notes and propose validation rerun.
