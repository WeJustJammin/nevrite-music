# Protocol 8: Spec Pipeline Update

> Part of [Session Continuity](../SKILL.md) — read the index for overview, directory structure, and integration points.

**Invoked by**: `/write-architecture-spec`, `/write-be-spec`, `/write-fe-spec`
(after updating the layer index)

**Purpose**: Mark a spec column done and report pipeline progress.

## Steps

1. **Identify the shard and layer** — which shard just got its spec completed,
   and which layer (IA, BE, or FE)?

2. **Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/spec-pipeline.md`** — before updating any cell, perform these validation checks:

   (a) Read the `File` column for the shard from the tracker to get the expected file path.
   (b) Confirm the file exists at that path. If not → **skip the update** and report: `"Cannot mark [shard] [layer] as complete — file not found at [path]"`
   (c) Read the file and confirm it contains no skeleton placeholder markers (`[To be filled`, `<!-- TODO -->`, `Status: Skeleton`). If any are present → **skip the update** and report: `"Cannot mark [shard] [layer] as complete — skeleton placeholders remain in [path]: [list of markers found]"`
   (d) Only on all-pass: update the column to `complete`:
   ```markdown
   | 03 | user-profiles | `.memory/wiki/specs/ia/03-user-profiles.md` | complete | complete | not-started |
   ```
   (e) On any failure: skip the update and report the exact path and failure reason.

3. **Recalculate overall progress**:
   ```markdown
   **Overall**: 8/45 specs (18%)
   ```

4. **Update "Spec Completion Tracking"** — if a shard now has all three specs
   complete (IA ✅ + BE ✅ + FE ✅), add it to the completion tracking list. Note: /plan-phase requires ALL shards to be complete, not just this one.
   ```markdown
   ## Spec Completion Tracking

   Shards with all three specs complete (tracking only — /plan-phase requires ALL shards to be complete, not just individual ones):
   - ✅ Shard 00: API conventions
   - ✅ Shard 01: Authentication
   ```

5. **Report status** — log what was completed and what's next.

6. **Read-back verification** — immediately after updating the tracker:

   (a) Read `.memory/pipeline/progress/spec-pipeline.md` back.
   (b) Locate the row for the shard that was just updated.
   (c) Verify the column that was just marked shows `complete` (not `not-started`, not unchanged, not any other value).
   (d) If the cell does NOT show `complete`:
       - Log: `"Pipeline tracker write-back failed for shard [NN] [layer] column — cell still shows [current value]"`
       - Retry the write once.
       - Read back and re-verify.
       - If second attempt fails → **STOP**: `"Unable to update spec-pipeline.md for shard [NN] [layer] after 2 attempts. Do not proceed — investigate before continuing."`
   (e) On success: log `"Pipeline tracker verified: shard [NN] [layer] = complete"`

7. **Refresh the spec graph** — after tracker verification succeeds:

   (a) Call the `memory_compile` MCP tool to rebuild derived memory artifacts from current spec truth.
   (b) Confirm the compile succeeded and reported graph outputs (`specGraphNodes`, `specGraphEdges`).
   (c) Treat this compile as mandatory before reporting the workflow complete.
   (d) This is the primary graph-freshness path for spec-writing workflows; the Stop hook remains the session-end backstop.
   (e) Because the graph is rebuilt from source specs, corrections/removals must be allowed to delete stale edges on this compile pass.

8. **Report status** — log what was completed and what's next.
