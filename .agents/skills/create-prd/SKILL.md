# Create PRD / Architecture Design

Transform the ideation output into a production-grade architecture design document with explicit decisions on every axis.

**Input**: `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md` (must exist and be approved)
**Output**: `.memory/wiki/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-architecture-design.md` + `.memory/wiki/specs/ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` + `.memory/wiki/specs/data-placement-strategy.md`

> **Depth standard**: Every section must be specified to the point where a developer cannot misinterpret it. The specificity-standards rule (`.agents/rules/specificity-standards.md`) applies to every word of the output.

---

## 1. Read ideation output

Read `.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md`.

If the file doesn't exist → **STOP**: tell the user to run `/ideate` first.

**Completeness validation**: If the file exists, verify it contains these required sections:
- `## Structural Classification`
- `## Engagement Tier`
- `## MoSCoW Summary` (with at least 1 Must Have feature)

If any required section is missing → **STOP**: "ideation-index.md is incomplete — missing `[section]`. Run `/ideate` to complete ideation before proceeding."

Use the **Structure Map** in `ideation-index.md` to locate: constraints, personas, domain details (fractal tree), cross-cutting concerns, and role coverage.

Pay special attention to **Project Surfaces** in `meta/constraints.md` — it determines which tech stack axes apply.

Read `## Engagement Tier` from `ideation-index.md`. If not set, ask the user and write immediately.

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/engagement-tier-protocol.md` — each shard reads the tier and adapts gates.

---

## 1.5. Deep ideation loading (scale-aware)

Read the `## Progress Summary` table in `ideation-index.md`. Check these thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Total domains | ≥ 6 |
| Total leaf features | ≥ 50 |
| Total surfaces | ≥ 2 (multi-product projects) |

**If ANY threshold is met** → read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/deep-ideation-loading-protocol.md` and follow its full procedure. This produces a **Domain Digest Table** written to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` as `## Ideation Digest`.

**If no threshold is met** → skip this step. The standard `ideation-index.md` read from Step 1 is sufficient.

> **Why**: For large ideation outputs (50+ features across 6+ domains), the Structure Map and MoSCoW Summary in `ideation-index.md` are insufficient for accurate architecture decisions. The digest reads every domain-level `*-index.md` to capture the full feature inventory, role coverage, and cross-domain dependencies without needing to load hundreds of leaf files.

## 2. Load skills

Read each skill SKILL.md listed in the frontmatter `skills` array.

Check `.agents/skills/` for stack-specific skills. Read `.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md` for community skill discovery.

## Shard Overview

| # | Shard | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [`create-prd-stack`](.agents/skills/create-prd-stack/SKILL.md) | Constraint-first discovery, tech stack decisions with bootstrap firing |
| 1.5 | [`create-prd-design-system`](.agents/skills/create-prd-design-system/SKILL.md) | Navigation paradigm, layout grid, page archetypes, component hierarchy, motion, state design language → `.memory/wiki/specs/design-system.md` |
| 2 | [`create-prd-architecture`](.agents/skills/create-prd-architecture/SKILL.md) | System architecture, data strategy, data placement strategy document |
| 3 | [`create-prd-security`](.agents/skills/create-prd-security/SKILL.md) | Security model, compliance escalation, integration points |
| 4 | [`create-prd-compile`](.agents/skills/create-prd-compile/SKILL.md) | Development methodology, phasing, compile architecture-design.md + ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md |

> **Progressive working artifact**: `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` is written incrementally by shards 1–3 and read by shard 4 to compile the final dated `architecture-design.md`.

---

## Orchestration

Create `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/` directory if it does not exist. Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/workflow-checkpoint-protocol.md` — all shards use this checkpoint system.

### Step A — Run `.agents/skills/create-prd-stack/SKILL.md`
### Step A.5 — Run `.agents/skills/create-prd-design-system/SKILL.md`
### Step B — Run `.agents/skills/create-prd-architecture/SKILL.md`
### Step C — Run `.agents/skills/create-prd-security/SKILL.md`
### Step D — Run `.agents/skills/create-prd-compile/SKILL.md`

**Shard failure recovery**: If any shard (A through D) fails mid-execution:
1. Check `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md` for the checkpoint — it shows exact step, item, and next action
2. Check `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` for the last completed section
3. Present the current state to the user: "Shard [N] failed at `{current_item}` (step `{current_step}`). Resume from failure point or restart the shard?"
4. Do NOT proceed to the next shard until the current shard completes cleanly

---

## Step E — Quality gate

### Self-check against Architecture rubric

Read `.agents/skills/pipeline-rubrics/references/architecture-rubric.md` and apply all 15 dimensions as the self-check.

Read `.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/architecture-completeness-checklist.md` and verify all items.

For any dimension that scores ⚠️ or ❌ → resolve it NOW. Loop back to the relevant shard.

**Remediation loop guard**: Track remediation attempts per dimension. After **3 failed attempts** on the same dimension → **STOP**: present the dimension to the user as a known gap with context on what was tried. Include it in the review presentation as an unresolved item for user decision.

> ❌ STOP — do not call notify_user until all dimensions score ✅ and all checklist items pass.

**Checkpoint cleanup**: After quality gate passes, delete `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture/prd-working/workflow-state.md` — process tracking is no longer needed. Keep synthesis files (`stack-synthesis.md`, `design-system-synthesis.md`) as audit trail.

### Depth audit

Re-read the entire architecture document and for EACH section ask: "Could a developer implement this without asking a single clarifying question?"

If no → identify what's missing, add the detail NOW, re-check.

> **Note**: This is an internal self-check. For a rigorous independent audit, run `/audit-ambiguity architecture` after this workflow completes.

## Step F — Request review and next steps

Use `notify_user` to present both documents with self-check results.

**STOP** — do NOT proceed until the user explicitly approves.

### Next step

**STOP** — do NOT propose `/decompose-architecture` or any other pipeline workflow. The only valid next step is:

- `/audit-ambiguity architecture` — unconditionally mandatory. The self-check above cannot replace an independent audit. After the audit passes, the next step is `/decompose-architecture`.

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion to the user:

1. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write any patterns, decisions, or blockers from this workflow to `.memory/wiki/`. If nothing to write, confirm: "No new patterns/decisions/blockers."
2. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
3. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.
