## Overview


## Step-by-Step

1. Load propagation scan report.
2. Walk explicit contradictions one at a time (apply/skip/edit/stop-and-save).
3. Walk implicit assumptions and flag for ambiguity handling where accepted.
4. Run consistency check on changed documents.
5. Write `.memory/wiki/specs/audits/propagation-[type]-[date].md`.
6. Call `memory_compile` to refresh the spec graph from the corrected spec set.
7. Present completion summary with graph refresh confirmation and next steps.
