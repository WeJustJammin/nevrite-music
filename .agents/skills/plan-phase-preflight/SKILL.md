## Overview


## Prerequisites

1. Approved IA/BE/FE specs exist
2. Progress state files exist under `.memory/pipeline/progress/`

## Step-by-Step

### Step 0 — Phase sequencing gate

1. Read `.memory/pipeline/progress/index.md` for current phase number.
2. If planning Phase N>1, verify Phase N-1 is complete and has passing `/validate-phase`.
3. Run architecture map freshness warning gate for N>1 (warning + user resolution).

### Step 1 — Planning skill load

1. Load testing-strategist and technical-writer planning guidance.

### Step 2 — Application completeness audit

1. Read surfaces from tech-stack map.
2. Run only applicable checks by surface class:
   - route coverage
   - navigation coverage
   - auth state coverage
   - empty/error states
   - onboarding
   - web/desktop global error pages
   - cli help/exit/discovery coverage
3. If any applicable check fails, stop and require FE spec remediation.

### Step 3 — Cross-layer consistency hard gates

1. Run BE↔FE coverage checks (with internal-only exception handling).
2. Enforce minimum consistency checks:
   - field mapping integrity
   - BE error code FE propagation
   - access-control role consistency
   - IA→BE contract drift
   - optimistic update rollback support
3. If mismatches exist, stop and require resolution.

### Step 4 — Feature ledger verification (conditional)

1. If feature ledger exists, verify no orphan statuses in IA/BE/FE columns.
2. Block progression when orphaned features remain.

### Step 5 — Draft continuity decision

1. Detect existing `.memory/wiki/specs/phases/phase-N-draft.md`.
2. Require explicit user decision to continue missing slices vs start fresh.
