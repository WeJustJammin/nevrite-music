## Active

- **P2-S09 external release evidence** (updated 2026-09-21) — Slice 09 remains
  at **279/282 active** (**283 authored IDs**) with authored depth ratio
  **0.986**. Phase 2 has **1,999 active criteria / 2,000 authored** because
  AC266 is owner-deferred and excluded from the active completion denominator.
  Current `main` is PR #81 at
  `f8a6b77e529c7b150df367f5ce59e43b1aed0db1`; exact-main CI
  [run 35560004822](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/35560004822)
  and staging [run 35560514952](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/35560514952)
  passed, producing staging deployment `6561553954`. AC265 preflight
  [run 34824500796](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34824500796)
  passed; authorization foundation [run 34824651793](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34824651793)
  failed at `staging_prepare`, so no hosted browser acceptance ran. Read-only
  AC209 verifier [run 34813947512](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34813947512)
  failed with `provider_graphql_error` and produced no email, queue mutation,
  deployment, or receipt. AC211 collection [run 35560241699](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/35560241699)
  passed preflight but collection failed for insufficient samples
  (`commands=0`, `protectedRpcs=0`, `acceptances=0`,
  `queueFirstAttempts=0`) and produced no artifact. AC266 is owner-deferred
  because the required real devices are unavailable; it remains unchecked and
  is excluded from active Phase 2 completion, but is mandatory for post-Phase 2
  production-readiness/release. No active acceptance gate closed. Slice 10
  remains locked only on AC209, AC211, and AC265; AC266 does not block Slice 10
  implementation. Fresh 2026-09-21 local validation
  passes **536 Vitest files / 4,234 tests plus one skip**, 100% coverage,
  **101 functional + 5 real Slice 09 E2E tests**, and performance smoke
  (`p95=1.527671 ms`, threshold `500 ms`, zero errors). Fresh database
  verification passes **52 pgTAP files / 1,917 tests** with migrated type parity.

## Historical

- **P2-S09 external release evidence (PR #79 snapshot)** (updated 2026-09-14) — Slice 09 remains
  at **279/283** with depth ratio **0.986**. [PR #79](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/pull/79)
  merged the GitHub token-service host and safe phase-diagnostic correction as
  `e68d2e7d92867d3f00ac1942a430437dc5c5be9e`; exact-main CI
  [run 34818589300](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34818589300)
  and staging [run 34819154810](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34819154810)
  passed, producing staging deployment `6432620253`. Fresh AC265 preflight
  [run 34819341770](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34819341770)
  failed before enrollment or artifact publication because GitHub reported the
  exact CI run's `created_at` one second after `run_started_at`. Every other
  workflow, SHA, repository, run-attempt, artifact, deployment, migration, and
  provider predicate passed; all 240 candidate files matched the CI artifact.
  The local TDD correction permits at most five seconds of positive
  created/start skew, proves exactly five seconds passes and six seconds fails,
  and leaves completion, CI-before-staging, identity, and artifact checks
  strict. The full live provenance tuple now passes locally, but this correction
  still requires promotion and a new protected preflight before authorization
  can be retried. Latest local validation passes **535 Vitest files / 4,228
  tests plus one skip**, 100% coverage, **101 functional + 5 real Slice 09 E2E
  tests**, and performance smoke (`p95=0.963413 ms`).
  Production remains on `c8f0cbd52cb6140ee1a756f106fa329f8c23b0e2` /
  deployment `6417116181`. Read-only AC209 verifier
  [run 34813947512](https://github.com/WeJustJammin/nevrite-music/actions/runs/34813947512)
  repeated the `emailSendingAdaptive` `provider_graphql_error` without an email,
  queue mutation, or deployment, so Zone Analytics Read is still not proven and
  a genuine exercise receipt is still absent. AC211 still lacks its qualifying
  natural production day; AC265 still needs successful hosted authorization and
  its protected 9-role/10-scenario matrix; AC266 still lacks real VoiceOver and
  NVDA reports. No acceptance gate closed. All four remain open, keeping Slices
  10–17 dependency-locked. Evidence:

## Resolved

- **P2-S09 promotion controls** (2026-09-04) — GitHub `main` protection is live
  with the required exact three Actions checks, zero required approvals under
  the single-account policy, stale/last-push review controls, administrator
  enforcement, linear history, conversation
  resolution, and force-push/deletion protection. Staging custom branch policy
  and the fail-closed hosted-migration contract with step-scoped credentials
  and immutable `staging-migration-evidence` are verified by 30 focused tests.
  This resolves the control plane only; it does not assert credentials,
  migration execution, deployment, or readiness.
- **P2-S09 exact-SHA staging promotion execution** (2026-09-04) — Candidate
  `5d6e49f34b678c59da2ac4f7059f08e6dc3b4790` passed CI run `33917604565`, staging
  run `33918141133`, and deployment `6272586576`; hosted migration
  `20260902080000` expanded successfully. GitHub Actions and deployment actor:
  `WeJustJammin`. Evidence:
  `.memory/wiki/specs/audits/verify-infrastructure-2026-09-04-1703.md`.
