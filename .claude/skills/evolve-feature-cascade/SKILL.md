## Overview


## Step-by-Step

1. Run locked-decision conflict check.
2. Cascade updates layer-by-layer with stop/approval at each layer.
3. Append changelog entries to modified specs.
4. Assess implementation/phase impact.
5. Run consistency checks.
6. Write evolution record.
7. Run bootstrap check for newly introduced dependencies.
8. Call `memory_compile` to refresh the graph after downstream spec updates.
9. Propose mandatory ambiguity-audit rerun for affected layers.
