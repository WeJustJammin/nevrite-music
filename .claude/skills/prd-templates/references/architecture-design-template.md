# [Project Name] — Architecture Design

> **Ideation**: [link to ideation-index.md]
> **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Status**: Draft | Review | Approved
> **Project Type**: [Single-surface: web/desktop/mobile/CLI/API | Multi-surface: list surfaces]

## Tech Stack
[Explicit decision for each applicable axis with rationale — not just the choice,
but WHY this choice over alternatives, what trade-offs were accepted, and what
constraints drove the decision. For multi-surface projects, organized by surface.]

## System Architecture
[Component diagram, data flow, deployment topology — every service named, every
communication path documented, every failure mode identified. For multi-surface:
include surface interconnection diagram and shared domain boundary.]

## Data Strategy
[Placement, schema design, query patterns, migrations — which data lives where
and why, what the hot paths are, how schema evolves. For multi-surface: data
ownership, sync protocol, conflict resolution.]

## Error Architecture
[Global error envelope with locked example JSON — all four fields defined with types. Error
propagation chain per layer (DB → service → API handler → transport → client) — what is caught,
logged, and exposed at each layer. Unhandled exception strategy — process-level catch, log fields,
client response, alerting timeline. Client fallback contract per surface — offline mode decision,
UI behaviour on network failure, retry strategy, timeout threshold. Error boundary strategy per
applicable surface — boundary placement and fallback rendering.]

## Security Model
[Auth, authorization, validation, rate limits — every flow specified step-by-step,
every permission rule scoped, every error case handled]

## Compliance & Safety
[If applicable — full depth on minors/payments/health/regulated domains.
This section may be the largest in the document if compliance constraints
are significant. Every account type, every consent flow, every content filter,
every notification trigger, every audit requirement.]

## API Design
[Surface type, versioning, conventions — endpoint naming, request/response shapes,
error format, pagination strategy. For multi-surface: shared API contract format.]

## Integration Points
[External services, failure modes, fallbacks, cost models — for each: what it
provides, what happens when it's down, what the fallback is]

## Observability Architecture
[Logging strategy — library named, structured JSON (yes/no for prod), log levels per environment,
PII field names that are never logged (named explicitly), log destination. Tracing strategy —
service boundaries traced, sampling rate per environment, trace ID propagation to API clients.
Alerting thresholds — error rate %, latency threshold + duration, queue depth warning, delivery
mechanism named. Launch dashboards — minimum required panels named, tool named, owner named.
Retention — log retention duration, trace retention duration, compliance alignment.]

## Development Methodology
[Contract-first, TDD, vertical slices, spec layers, quality gates — the full
process, not just labels]

## Phasing
[Phase breakdown with feature allocation, dependency order, and timeline estimates.
Each phase has explicit entry/exit criteria. For multi-surface: per-surface or
cross-surface phasing strategy.]

## Directory Structure
[The approved source directory tree from Step 9.5, with one-line descriptions per directory.
Includes: contracts directory path, test layout, build output path, surface subtrees for multi-surface projects.]

## Architecture Separation
[The concern/location/runtime table from Step 9.5 — maps each architectural concern to its
directory and the runtime where it executes.]

## Installed Skills
[List of skills installed during this workflow with versions]

## Decisions Log
[Every decision made during this workflow with rationale — not just what was
decided, but what alternatives were considered and why they were rejected]

## Open Questions
[Anything needing resolution before decomposition — with owner and deadline]
