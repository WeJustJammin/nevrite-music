# Write Frontend Specification

**Input**: A complete BE spec (and its IA source shard)
**Output**: Full FE spec with components, routing, state, interactions, accessibility

> **Parallelism Note**: `parallel-with: [write-be-spec]` means BE and FE spec workflows can run **in parallel across different IA shards** (e.g., shard 01 BE + shard 02 FE simultaneously). For the **same IA shard**, BE spec must complete before FE spec starts — the FE classify shard requires a completed BE spec as input.

## Skill Bootstrap

Check installed skills for frontend-relevant coverage:
- Frontend framework skill (e.g., React, Astro, Svelte)
- Frontend design / UI/UX patterns skill
- Accessibility / WCAG skill
- CSS framework skills (e.g., `tailwind-css-patterns` for utilities, `tailwind-design-system` for tokens/CVA/theming)
- Web performance optimization skill
- i18n / localization skill (if needed)

If a needed skill is missing, check if a matching entry exists in `.agents/skill-library/MANIFEST.md`. Read `.agents/skills/bootstrap-agents/SKILL.md` and execute its utility instructions immediately with the appropriate stack key to install it. **HARD GATE**: Follow the bootstrap verification protocol (`.agents/skills/prd-templates/references/bootstrap-verification-protocol.md`). Confirm the matching skill is installed before proceeding.

## Shard Overview

| # | Shard | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [`write-fe-spec-classify`](.agents/skills/write-fe-spec-classify/SKILL.md) | Classifies the target, loads skills, reads all source documents + cross-references + deep dives |
| 2 | [`write-fe-spec-write`](.agents/skills/write-fe-spec-write/SKILL.md) | Writes the FE spec, updates indexes, runs ambiguity gate, checks for new dependencies |

## Orchestration

### Step 0 — Pipeline State Check

1. Read `.memory/pipeline/progress/spec-pipeline.md`.
   - If the file does not exist → **STOP**: "No pipeline tracker found. Run `/decompose-architecture` first."
2. Identify all shards where the FE column = `not-started` AND the BE column = `complete`.
   - If no shards have BE `complete` → **STOP**: "BE layer not complete — run `/write-be-spec` first."
   - If all eligible shards already have FE `complete` → **STOP**: "All FE specs are complete. Next step: `/plan-phase`."
3. Auto-select the lowest-numbered eligible shard.
4. Present: "Pipeline tracker shows **shard [NN — name]** is the next shard needing an FE spec. Proceeding. Say 'override' to pick a different one."
5. Pass the selected shard to Step A.

### Step A — Run `.agents/skills/write-fe-spec-classify/SKILL.md`

Identifies the target FE spec, classifies it (feature spec / cross-cutting), loads the skill bundle, reads all source documents (BE spec, IA shard, cross-shard references, deep dives with FE implications), and reads cross-cutting FE specs.

### Step B — Run `.agents/skills/write-fe-spec-write/SKILL.md`

Writes the FE spec to `.memory/wiki/specs/fe/`, updates the FE index, runs cross-reference checks and the ambiguity gate, checks for new dependencies (firing bootstrap if needed), and presents for review.

## Quality Gate

**BLOCKING GATE** — Do NOT call `notify_user` or proceed to the next step until ALL items pass:

Read .agents/skills/code-review-pro/SKILL.md and apply its adversarial review discipline to each checklist item.

- [ ] Every component has a props interface
- [ ] Every interactive element has defined behavior
- [ ] Every data field maps to a BE response field (if applicable)
- [ ] Loading, error, and empty states defined for every data-fetching view
- [ ] Accessibility requirements meet WCAG 2.1 AA
- [ ] Responsive behavior specified for all breakpoints
- [ ] IA shard's accessibility section fully consumed (not re-derived from BE spec)
- [ ] Source Map is complete — no FE spec section lacks a traceable source

## Completion Gate (MANDATORY)

Before reporting completion to the user:

1. **Memory check** — Apply rule `memory-capture`. Write any patterns, decisions, or blockers from this workflow to `.memory/wiki/`. If nothing to write, confirm: "No new patterns/decisions/blockers."
2. **Progress update** — Update `.memory/pipeline/progress/` tracking files if they exist.
3. **Session log** — Write session entry to `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.
