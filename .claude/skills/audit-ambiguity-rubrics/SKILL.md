## Overview


## Prerequisites

1. Target layer(s) have discoverable documents

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1 — Determine audit scope

1. Select one of: vision, architecture, ia, be, fe, all.
2. If no scope input is provided, collect it before continuing.

### Step 2 — Enumerate documents from filesystem

1. Load document-to-layer mapping rules from scoring reference.
2. Discover all matching files recursively via filesystem enumeration.
3. Enforce document enumeration gate:
   - report count by layer
   - re-scan when below expected threshold
   - explain low-count exceptions when still below threshold

### Step 3 — Persist audit scope and rubric file map

Write `.memory/wiki/specs/audits/audit-scope.md` including:
- layers to audit
- complete document list
- per-layer document count
- exact rubric file paths
- status marker

### Step 4 — Load rubric skill context

1. Load pipeline-rubrics scoring methodology.
2. Prepare execution handoff using persisted rubric paths.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] scope selected
- [ ] documents enumerated from filesystem
- [ ] enumeration gate passed
- [ ] audit-scope.md persisted with rubric paths
- [ ] execution handoff prepared
