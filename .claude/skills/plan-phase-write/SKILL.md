## Overview


## Prerequisites

1. Preflight shard passed
2. Scope sources available (architecture phasing + BE/FE indexes)

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1 — Read phase scope

1. Read architecture design phasing section.
2. Read BE index to determine in-scope specs.

### Step 2 — Spec-anchored slice derivation

1. Derive candidate slices from FE interaction specification user flows.
2. Map each flow to BE endpoints via source map.
3. Group only when strict dependency criteria are met.
4. Size slices (S/M/L) as informational metadata only.
5. Do not split, merge, or drop slices to hit a complexity target. L slices are surfaced with a one-line note; splitting is permitted only when the spec contains a natural seam.
6. Slice count is informational only — no warn or hard-stop thresholds. Phase splitting is justified by dependency boundaries, never by count.

### Step 3 — Spec coverage verification gate

1. Build BE endpoint coverage table (covered/uncov/deferred).
2. Build FE component coverage table.
3. Require every endpoint/component to be assigned or explicitly deferred before proceeding.
4. Update feature-ledger slice assignment when ledger exists.
5. Add split-companion context notes for letter-suffixed split groups.

### Step 4 — Dependency ordering and infrastructure gates

1. Order slices by dependency.
2. Enforce infrastructure-first rules and `/setup-workspace` prerequisite gate.
3. Add explicit `/verify-infrastructure` hard-gate checkpoints in the phase plan.
4. Incorporate parallelization guidance while preserving TDD order constraints.

### Step 5 — Acceptance criteria writing (write-as-you-go)

1. For each slice, write acceptance criteria using operational template.
2. Every criterion must include source citation (`[BE §..]`, `[FE §..]`, `[IA §..]`).
3. Append each completed slice progressively to `phase-N-draft.md`.

### Step 5.5 — Slice depth floor (mandatory)

1. Read `.claude/skills/prd-templates/references/slice-depth-floor.md` in full.
2. For every slice, compute the minimum acceptance-criteria count using its formula and annotate the slice in `phase-N-draft.md` with the floor and breakdown.
3. Hard gate: every slice's criteria count MUST equal or exceed the floor. If short, return to Step 5 and add criteria traceable to concrete spec items.
4. Apply Spec Thinness Detection: if any slice's referenced spec section produces zero items in a required category, STOP and tell the user to run `/resolve-ambiguity` on the thin spec before continuing.

### Step 6 — Finalize and generate progress artifacts

1. Finalize `phase-N.md` from draft source.
2. Generate progress files via progress-generation protocol.
3. Run bootstrap/map completeness gate for planning-critical categories.

### Step 7 — Graph refresh, review request, and constrained next step

1. Run `memory_compile` after finalizing phase artifacts so graph/hubs reflect the latest planning state.
2. Present phase plan + progress artifacts for approval.
3. Include graph refresh confirmation.
4. Stop until explicit approval.
5. Recommend only `/implement-slice` as next command after approval.
