# CFSA Antigravity - Architecture

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level map of the agentic machinery that powers CFSA Antigravity.

This document serves as a guide to understanding how the CFSA kit is organized across its agent runtimes. The `.agents/` runtime serves Antigravity-style installs, `.codex/` serves Codex installs, and `.claude/` owns Claude-specific execution assets. A shared project-level `.memory/` root now provides the canonical cross-runtime memory layer.

## 1. Code Organization

The kit ships multiple runtime trees in this repository:

├── runtime/                 # daemon pid/state files
└── hooks/
```

`.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.claude/`, and `.factory/` implement the same CFSA pipeline for different agent environments. Codex uses the `.codex/` runtime plus the root `CODEX.md` guidance file. Each runtime owns its own execution assets. Shared project state lives under `.memory/`.

The `.memory/` directory is not just an internal store; it is intended to be an Obsidian-friendly vault within the project space so humans and agents can browse the same memory corpus directly. It also mirrors durable `.memory/wiki/specs/` artifacts into graph-friendly vault notes so IA/BE/FE specs, phase plans, and related knowledge become traversable Obsidian graph nodes. Runtime clients should connect to one shared project-local memory daemon rather than each spawning their own isolated server process.

That routing is now workspace-safe: the daemon publishes `projectRoot`, `memoryRoot`, and endpoint metadata into `.memory/runtime/cfsa-memory-daemon.json` and its `/health` payload; the client resolves the local workspace daemon from that runtime state and rejects mismatched workspace identity instead of trusting a shared default port.

```

### Core Components

The concepts are the same across these runtimes; only the concrete paths differ.

*   **Instructions:** (`workflow.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `structure.md`, `patterns.md`, `commands.md`) Baseline knowledge the agent needs to operate in the specific environment. These files ship as templates with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers — they are not static files. The bootstrap system fills them progressively as tech decisions are confirmed during `/create-prd`. An instruction file with unfilled placeholders is a broken agent context. `workflow.md` enforces the mandatory execution sequence: Understand Context -> Check Skills -> Execute -> Validate.
*   **Rules:** Preemptively loaded constraints that apply to *every* task. Covers security, TDD, vertical slices, debugging discipline, memory capture, questioning style, and more. See `GEMINI.md` → Agent Rules table for the full list.
*   **Skill Library:** Each runtime has its own `skill-library/` directory. It contains installable skill packages organized by category (e.g., `stack/databases/`, `stack/frontend-frameworks/`). Each runtime provisions skills from its own `skill-library/` into its own `skills/` directory and keeps its own `MANIFEST.md`.
*   **Skills:** Modular capabilities (e.g., `technical-writer`, `brainstorming`). Agents load these explicitly when a task requires them, preventing context bloat.
*   **Workflows:** Step-by-step markdown checklists invoked via `/slash-commands` (e.g., `/create-prd`, `/implement-slice`). They chain skills together to achieve complex, multi-stage goals.

## 2. Ideation Architecture

The ideation layer is the pipeline's first output and the source of truth for all downstream specification work. It uses a **fractal folder structure** — every node (surface, domain, sub-domain) is a folder containing an index file, a cross-cut (CX) file, and its children. Leaf nodes are `.md` feature files. This pattern is universal regardless of project complexity.

### Pipeline Key File

`.memory/wiki/specs/ideation/ideation-index.md` is the **pipeline key file** — the primary entry point for all downstream workflows. When `/create-prd`, `/decompose-architecture`, or any specification workflow needs to understand the product, it reads `ideation-index.md` first, then follows links into the fractal tree.

`.memory/wiki/specs/vision.md` still exists but is a **human-readable executive summary** only — a sales pitch compiled from the ideation folder. No downstream workflow reads it as a data source.

### Structural Classification (4 Project Shapes)

During `/ideate-extract`, every project is classified into one of four shapes that governs folder layout:

| Shape | When | Folder Pattern |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `single-surface` | One surface (e.g., web app only) | Flat `domains/` at top level |
| `multi-surface-shared` | Multiple surfaces sharing the same backend (e.g., web + mobile) | Flat `domains/` with surface annotations in feature files |
| `multi-product-hub` | One primary surface owns most logic; others consume it | Primary surface's folder owns shared domains; others reference them |
| `multi-product-peer` | Independent products with shared infrastructure | `shared/` folder for shared domains; surface folders for exclusive domains |

### Fractal Folder Structure

├── ideation-index.md          # Super-index — shape, structure map, MoSCoW, progress
├── ideation-cx.md             # Global CX — cross-surface interactions (if multi-product)

        ├── mobile-index.md
        ├── mobile-cx.md
        └── 01-notifications/...
```

**Key properties:**
- **Fractal pattern**: Every folder has an index + CX file. Every leaf is a feature `.md` file. This is universal — no exceptions.
- **Reactive depth**: Folders are created during exploration when complexity is discovered, not pre-scaffolded. A feature file can be promoted to a sub-domain folder if it reveals internal complexity.
- **Numbering**: Children are numbered `{NN}-{slug}` within their parent. Paths are expressed as dot-separated (e.g., `01.02.03` = domain 01, sub-domain 02, feature 03).
- **Soft depth limit**: 4 levels recommended. Level 5 triggers a user prompt to confirm structured complexity isn't runaway nesting.

### Role Integration

Roles (personas) are defined once in `meta/personas.md` and then referenced at every level of the tree:

| Location | What | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `meta/personas.md` | Full persona definitions (6 fields each) | Single source of truth |
| Node index files | **Role Matrix** — which personas access which children | Structural overview of role coverage |
| Feature files | **Role Lens** — per-persona behavior details | Downstream input for IA/BE/FE multitenancy specs |

### Node Classification Gate

Before creating any new node (domain, sub-domain, or feature), the agent runs a classification gate:

1. **What is it?** — Domain (top-level concept), sub-domain (2+ interacting capabilities), or feature (single capability)
2. **Where does it go?** — Surface-exclusive, hub-owned, shared, or top-level (depends on project shape)
3. **Does it already exist?** — Check for duplicates before creating

This prevents incorrect domain placement — the primary failure mode of the old flat structure.

### Exploration Model

The `/ideate` workflow uses **recursive breadth-before-depth exploration**:

| Level | Scope | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Level 0** | Global domain map | Identify all top-level domains. Run Classification Gate for each. Create domain folders. |
| **Level 1** | Domain breadth sweep | For each domain, identify sub-areas. Classification Gate: sub-domain folder or feature file? Update Role Matrix. |
| **Level 2+** | Vertical drilling | Drill each child. Fill feature files (Role Lens, behavior, edge cases). Promote features to sub-domains if complex. |

Each node tracks its status:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[SURFACE]` | Identified but unexplored |
| `[BREADTH]` | Children listed, not detailed |
| `[DEEP]` | Core logic, edge cases, interactions documented |
| `[EXHAUSTED]` | Deep Think yielded nothing new — domain complete |

Status propagates upward: a node is `[EXHAUSTED]` only when ALL its children are `[EXHAUSTED]`.

### Deep Think Protocol

At every exploration level, the agent actively generates hypotheses:

> *"Based on [industry knowledge / domain patterns / cross-domain interaction], I'd expect [feature/concern/edge case]. Is that relevant to your product?"*

Hypotheses are tracked in feature files with resolution status (confirmed/rejected/deferred). This prevents shallow exploration — the agent doesn't just record what the user says, it actively probes for what the user hasn't mentioned yet.

### Hierarchical Cross-Cuts

Cross-cutting concerns are tracked **at the level where they occur**, not in a single flat ledger:

| CX File Location | What It Tracks |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `ideation-cx.md` (global) | Cross-surface interactions (multi-product only) |
| `{surface}-cx.md` | Cross-domain interactions within a surface |
| `{domain}-cx.md` | Cross-sub-domain interactions within a domain |
| `{sub-domain}-cx.md` | Cross-feature interactions within a sub-domain |

Each CX entry includes which nodes interact, confidence level, 5 synthesis questions (trigger, data, flow, failure, scope), role scoping, and rejected pairs with reasoning.

### Downstream Consumption

| Consumer | What It Reads |
|----------|--------------|
| `/create-prd` | `ideation-index.md` + `meta/constraints.md` |
| `/decompose-architecture` | `ideation-index.md` + domain indexes (walks fractal tree for shard boundary signals: depth, child count, CX density, Role Matrix) |
| Spec workflows | Domain indexes + feature files for sub-feature detail |

> **Important**: Ideation does NOT prescribe shard boundaries. `/decompose-architecture` reads the fractal tree and makes architectural decisions about where to draw shard lines.

---

## 3. Data Flow & State Management

Agents are inherently stateless across conversations. The kit uses the **Session Continuity** protocol to provide a persistent memory system.

### Canonical Progress Directory

All runtimes use `.memory/pipeline/progress/` for phase tracking, spec-pipeline tracking, and session resumption. Runtime-local progress folders are legacy migration inputs only; new workflow, skill, and rule instructions must not point agents at `.agents/progress/`, `.codex/progress/`, `.claude/progress/`, or `.factory/progress/`.

```text
.memory/pipeline/progress/
├── index.md                      # Master checklist — phases + overall %
├── spec-pipeline.md              # Spec completion tracker (IA/BE/FE per shard)
├── phases/
│   └── phase-NN.md               # Per-phase slice checklist
├── slices/
│   └── phase-NN-slice-NN.md      # Per-slice log (only if ≥3 acceptance criteria)
├── sessions/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md             # Session log for resumption
└── memory/
    ├── patterns.md
    ├── blockers.md
    └── decisions.md
```

> **Adaptive Granularity Rule**: A slice gets its own file in `slices/` only when it has ≥3 acceptance criteria. Slices with 1–2 criteria are tracked inline in the phase file. This prevents file explosion for simple specs while giving granular tracking for complex ones.

> **Runtime vs. pre-shipped files**: The `phases/`, `slices/`, `sessions/`, and `memory/` directories ship as empty scaffolds under `.memory/pipeline/progress/`. Runtime-generated markdown inside them is created by `/plan-phase` (Protocol 2: Progress Generation), `/implement-slice` (Protocol 3: Progress Update), and session close.

### Flow

1.  **Resume**: On session start, workflows invoke Session Resumption (Protocol 1) — read `index.md` for overall status, find the latest `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` log, check unified `.memory/wiki/blockers.md` for unresolved blockers, and pull additional cross-runtime context through the MCP memory layer when available.
2.  **Act**: The agent executes the workflow against the phase plan in `phases/phase-NN.md`.
3.  **Persist**: At implementation checkpoints (Protocol 3: Progress Update via `/implement-slice`), the agent marks criteria `[x]`, updates phase progress, and logs findings into unified `.memory/wiki/patterns.md`, `.memory/wiki/decisions.md`, and `.memory/wiki/blockers.md`.
4.  **Close**: At session end, the agent writes `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (Protocol 5: Session Close) to enable clean resumption next session.

### Canonical-memory rule

The only canonical memory system shipped by the kit is the project-level `.memory/` vault.

- `.claude/memory/` is bridge documentation only
- `.factory/memory/` is bridge documentation only
- `.agents/progress/memory/`, `.codex/progress/memory/`, `.claude/progress/memory/`, and `.factory/progress/memory/` are legacy migration inputs, not primary memory stores

All new shared memory behavior should target `.memory/`.

### Unified memory architecture

The kit now separates runtime execution assets from shared project state:

- Canonical progress state lives under `.memory/pipeline/progress/`
- Canonical cross-runtime memory lives under `.memory/wiki/`
- Claude can use hooks in `.claude/settings.json` to flush and compile memory automatically when the user chooses to wire them
- All runtimes can access the same memory through their own MCP client config -> `cfsa-memory` -> `.memory/mcp-server/client.mjs` -> shared daemon `.memory/mcp-server/daemon.mjs`

The kit ships the server/runtime. Tool-specific MCP client configuration (for example `.mcp.json`) remains user-managed.

This lets Claude, Antigravity, Factory, Codex, and future runtimes query the same project memory without each runtime owning a separate canonical store.

### Cross-references

- **Dated File Convention** — See below in this section (Section 3) — governs which artifact paths use glob patterns vs. hardcoded names.
- **Placeholder Verification Gate Protocol** — See Section 4.5 — governs the Step 0 guard that prevents workflows from reading `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`-dependent skills before bootstrap has run.
- **Kit Maintenance Checklist** — See Section 6 — governs what must be updated when new workflows or skills are added.
- **Surface Model** — runtime-specific `prd-templates/references/surface-model.md` — The authoritative reference for surface types (web/mobile/cli/etc.) and implementation layers, and how the two models relate.

### Dated File Convention

A document is dated (prefixed with `YYYY-MM-DD-`) if and only if it is a **compiled artifact** — one that can be superseded by a newer version and both versions might need to coexist temporarily. Living documents that are updated in place are never dated.

| Document | Dated? | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture-design.md` | ✅ Yes | Can be re-run with new stack; old version referenced during migration |
| `ideation-index.md` | ❌ No | Living document — updated throughout ideation, not a dated compilation |
| `data-placement-strategy.md` | ✅ Yes | Same pattern |
| `ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` | ✅ Yes | Standards are versioned |
| Audit reports (`.memory/wiki/specs/audits/`) | ✅ Yes | Versioned snapshots by definition |
| Propagation scan reports | ✅ Yes | Same |
| IA shards (`.memory/wiki/specs/ia/`) | ❌ No | Living documents; updated in place by `/evolve-feature` |
| BE specs (`.memory/wiki/specs/be/`) | ❌ No | Living documents |
| FE specs (`.memory/wiki/specs/fe/`) | ❌ No | Living documents |
| Phase plans (`.memory/wiki/specs/phases/`) | ❌ No | Operational; history lives in progress tracking files |

Any workflow that reads a compiled artifact must use a glob pattern (e.g., `.memory/wiki/specs/*-architecture-design.md`), never a hardcoded non-dated path. The agent does not know the date the file was created, so the glob is the only reliable way to locate it.

---

## 4. Module Relationships

The power of the kit comes from how these modules interact:

*   **Workflows call Skills:** A workflow like `/create-prd` will explicitly instruct the agent to use the `technical-writer` and `brainstorming` skills.
*   **Rules constrain Workflows:** While a workflow dictates the *steps*, the rules dictate *how* those steps are performed (e.g., `/implement-slice` must obey `tdd-contract-first.md`).
*   **State informs Execution:** Each runtime reads from the shared progress directory (`.memory/pipeline/progress/`) to contextualize execution based on past decisions and current active phases.

### Frontmatter `skills:` Semantic

Workflow files declare skills in two places with different semantics:

| Location | Purpose | Scope |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Frontmatter `skills:` list** | **Dependency manifest** — declares the union of all skills this workflow and its shards may need | Informational tag; not an instruction to load |
| **Body `Read [runtime]/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`** | **Actionable instruction** — the agent reads and follows this skill during execution | Exact loading instruction |

**Parent orchestrators** (e.g., `implement-slice.md`, `write-be-spec.md`) list all skills their shards use in frontmatter but typically don't read them in their own body — their shards do the actual reading.

**Leaf workflows (shards)** should have body reads that match their frontmatter — if a skill is listed in a shard's frontmatter, the shard body should contain a corresponding `Read` instruction.

### Shared References (`prd-templates/references/`)

The `prd-templates` skill contains a `references/` directory with 23 shared reference files that are consumed by multiple workflows. These references eliminate content duplication by centralizing:

| Reference Category | Examples | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| **Document templates** | `architecture-design-template.md`, `be-spec-template.md`, `fe-spec-template.md` | Spec and PRD writing workflows |
| **Shared policies** | `tdd-testing-policy.md`, `slice-completion-gates.md` | Implementation and validation workflows |
| **Classification procedures** | `fe-classification-procedures.md`, `placeholder-guard-template.md` | Classify shards of spec workflows |
| **Design system** | `design-system-decisions.md`, `design-system-prerequisite-check.md` | FE spec and PRD workflows |
| **Cross-cutting protocols** | `skill-loading-protocol.md`, `spec-coverage-sweep.md`, `surface-model.md` | 15+ workflows |

When a workflow needs a policy, template, or procedure, it references the shared file rather than inlining the content. This keeps workflows focused on orchestration logic and keeps shared policies maintainable in one place.

### Skill Loading Protocol

Workflows that need stack-specific skills (Languages, Databases, FE Frameworks, etc.) reference the runtime-local `skills/prd-templates/references/skill-loading-protocol.md` instead of repeating the loading instructions inline. The protocol centralizes:

- How to read the surface stack map in `tech-stack.md`
- Which skill categories to load per workflow
- The missing-skill fallback procedure
- Surface stack map verification before loading

---

## 4.5. Bootstrap System

The bootstrap system transforms the kit from a generic template into a project-specific configuration. It runs as a utility workflow called by other pipeline workflows — never directly by the user.

### Components

*   **`bootstrap-agents-fill`**: Receives template key-value pairs and fills `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers across all instruction files and root agent config files (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`). Idempotent — only fills what's provided, leaves other placeholders untouched.
*   **`bootstrap-agents-provision`**: Reads the runtime-local skill library manifest, copies matching skills into the active runtime's skills directory, fills skill-specific placeholders, composes `FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS` from the installed frontend framework skill, and updates the installed skills list in all root config files.

### Invocation Model

Bootstrap fires **progressively** — once per confirmed tech decision during `/create-prd-stack`, not in a batch at the end:

1. **Database confirmed** → fills DB placeholders (`DATABASE`, `ORM`, etc.) + provisions the matching database skill from the active runtime's skill library (e.g., `stack/databases/surrealdb-expert`, `stack/databases/postgresql-patterns`)
2. **Frontend framework confirmed** → fills framework placeholders + provisions framework skill + composes `FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS` for `patterns.md`
3. **Step 9.5 of `/create-prd-compile`** → fills `PROJECT_STRUCTURE` and `ARCHITECTURE_TABLE` in `structure.md`

### Auto-filled vs. "If Provided" Keys

| Key | Auto-filled? | Generated by |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| `VALIDATION_COMMAND`, `TEST_COMMAND`, etc. | Yes | Derived from confirmed dev tooling |
| `DATABASE`, `AUTH_PROVIDER`, etc. | Yes | Confirmed tech decisions |
| `INSTALLED_SKILLS` | Yes | After skill provisioning |
| `PROJECT_STRUCTURE`, `ARCHITECTURE_TABLE` | **No — requires Step 9.5** | `/create-prd-compile` Step 9.5 |
| `FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS` | **No — requires framework skill** | `bootstrap-agents-provision` after framework provisioning |

### Placeholder Verification Gate Protocol

Workflows that read `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`-dependent skill paths declare their dependencies in frontmatter via the `requires_placeholders:` key — a machine-readable list of which placeholder values must be filled before the workflow can run.

```yaml
requires_placeholders: [DATABASE_SKILLS, SECURITY_SKILLS]
```

Two distinct gate types enforce placeholder readiness at different pipeline stages:

| Gate type | Where it runs | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec-phase gate** | Step 0 of specification workflows (`write-architecture-spec-design`, `write-be-spec-classify`, `write-fe-spec-classify`) | Before any skill reads | Guard spec authoring from unfilled stack placeholders |
| **Planning-phase gate** | `/plan-phase-write` | Before slice planning | Guard phase planning from unfilled CI/CD and Hosting skill placeholders |
| **Implementation-phase gate** | `/implement-slice-setup` Step -1 | Before any code is written | Guard code generation from broken agent context across all five instruction files |

All three gates emit a **four-part hard stop message** per unfilled placeholder:

1. **Which exact `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` is unfilled** — the literal placeholder name
2. **Which pipeline stage fills it** — the `/create-prd-stack` decision that triggers bootstrap
3. **The exact recovery command** — e.g., `/bootstrap-agents` with `DATABASE=<your-db-choice>`
4. **The consequence of proceeding without it** — what downstream step would produce incorrect output

**Key constraint:** No auto-refire of bootstrap. The agent stops and tells the user exactly what to run.

For detailed per-workflow placeholder mappings and recovery commands, see the runtime-local `skills/session-continuity/protocols/10-placeholder-verification-gate.md`.

**Reference implementation:** `write-be-spec-classify.md` Step 2.5 is the canonical example of a correctly implemented placeholder guard.

### Implementation-Phase Placeholder Gate

Before any implementation begins, `/implement-slice-setup` (Step -1) scans all five instruction files for unfilled `{{` patterns. If any are found, implementation stops with a specific remediation path per file. This gate is the last line of defense against broken agent context reaching the implementation phase.

## 5. Key Patterns

### Test-Driven Contract-First (CFPA)

The defining architectural pattern of the code produced by this kit.

1.  **Contract ({{CONTRACT_LIBRARY}}):** Define the schema first.
2.  **Tests (Failing):** Write tests that assert against the contract.
3.  **Implementation:** Write the code to make the tests pass.

*Never reverse this order.*

### Explicit Handoffs

Workflows are designed to end with explicit NEXT STEPS. An agent shouldn't guess what happens after `/ideate`; the workflow tells it to propose `/create-prd`. This ensures continuous, unbroken pipeline progression.

---

## 6. Kit Maintenance Checklist

**When a new workflow or shard is added to a runtime tree (`.agents/skills/`, `.codex/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md`, or `.claude/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md`):**

- [ ] Add a row to the `AGENTS.md` Pipeline Workflow Table
- [ ] Add a matching row to the `GEMINI.md` Pipeline Workflow Table (must stay in sync with `AGENTS.md`)
- [ ] If the workflow introduces a new system component or new convention, update the relevant section of `docs/kit-architecture.md`
- [ ] If the workflow uses new prd-template reference files, add them to `prd-templates/SKILL.md`
- [ ] If the workflow introduces a new skill, add it to the matching runtime's `skill-library/MANIFEST.md`

**When a new rule is added to a runtime tree (`.agents/rules/`, `.codex/rules/`, or `.claude/rules/`):**

- [ ] Add a row to the `GEMINI.md` Agent Rules table
- [ ] If the rule uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values, follow the placeholder checklist below

**When adding a `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` to any runtime rule file**

- [ ] Add the placeholder name and the rule file it lives in to the "Currently applicable" note in `bootstrap-agents-fill.md` Step 3 (the rules scan step)
- [ ] Add the corresponding bootstrap key to the `bootstrap-agents-fill.md` Step 1 key table if it doesn't already exist

**When `bootstrap-agents-fill.md` fills a placeholder in `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md`:**

- Bootstrap handles project-specific value substitution automatically
- Kit-level structural changes (new rows, new sections) require manual update per this checklist

**Note**: Both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` are co-maintained: project-specific sections by `bootstrap-agents-fill.md` Step 4, and structural/workflow sections by this checklist.

---

## 7. Git Integration

### Excluding runtime directories from Git without `.gitignore`

Do not hide the runtime directory your tool needs to index. If you need local-only exclusions, prefer the repository-local exclude file instead of shared `.gitignore` rules.

Examples:

```bash
echo '.agents/' >> .git/info/exclude
# or
echo '.codex/' >> .git/info/exclude
# or
echo '.claude/' >> .git/info/exclude
```

**Why this matters:**
- `.git/info/exclude` is local to your clone — it won't appear in diffs or affect collaborators
- Your editor can still index the installed runtime for full agent functionality
- No `.gitignore` pollution or merge conflicts from differing agent setups
- Each developer can manage their own runtime directory independently

> **Note:** If the project ships one or both runtime trees as part of the kit (like this starter), keep those tracked in Git and use local excludes only for runtime-generated files such as session logs or progress artifacts.
