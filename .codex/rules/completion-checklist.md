# Completion Checklist

> Code complete ≠ done. Tests pass ≠ done.
> Code complete + tests pass + tracking updated = DONE.

## The Problem

Working code is only half the job of a software engineer. The other half is communicating
that work, updating shared state, releasing locks, and documenting decisions so the rest of
the team (or your future self) can understand what happened.

When an agent reports a task as "complete" without updating the progress tracking files,
it breaks the pipeline. The next agent won't know what's done, dependencies get blocked,
and the human operator loses visibility.

## The Rule

**You are never "done" just because the code works and the tests pass.**

Before concluding any workflow, task, or slice — and especially before calling `notify_user`
to report completion — you must verify you have completed the administrative checklist.

## The Definition of Done

A unit of work is only DONE when:

1. **The Code**: Implementation meets the contract and acceptance criteria.
2. **The Tests**: All tests pass (validation step is green).
3. **The Tracking**: Progress markdown files in `.memory/pipeline/progress/` are updated.
   - Acceptance criteria marked `[x]`
   - Slice/Task marked `[x]`
   - Phase progress fractions updated (e.g., `3/10` → `4/10`)
   - Overall progress fractions updated
4. **The Locks**: All task claims (`[!]` flags and `files:` blocks) are removed.
5. **The Memory**: The unified project memory in `.memory/wiki/` is checked:
   - `patterns.md` — Any patterns observed (what worked, what failed) logged per Protocol 04. **User corrections are logged as anti-patterns.**
   - `decisions.md` — Any non-trivial decisions logged per Protocol 06
   - `blockers.md` — Any blockers hit logged with status and impact
   - See rule: `memory-capture` for triggers and format
6. **The Session Log**: A session close log exists in `.memory/pipeline/progress/sessions/`.
   - Follow `.codex/skills/session-continuity/protocols/05-session-close.md` — write what was accomplished, deferred, and where the next session should start
7. **The Next Step**: The user is told what comes next in the pipeline.
   - Read the pipeline progress file (`.memory/pipeline/progress/spec-pipeline.md` or equivalent)
   - Propose the next valid pipeline command based on current state
   - If multiple options exist, present them as a numbered list with brief context
   - If the pipeline stage is complete, say so explicitly

## Enforcement

If you are following a workflow that includes a "Completion Gate" or a checklist for
updating progress files, **you may not skip it**.

If you skip the progress tracking steps, you have failed the task, regardless of how
good the code is.
