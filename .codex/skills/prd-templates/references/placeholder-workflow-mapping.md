# Map Column Reference

Maps surface stack map columns and cross-cutting categories to the workflows that consume them.

> **How workflows use the map**: See `.codex/instructions/tech-stack.md` for the surface stack map format and resolution rules. Workflows determine their surface context (from shard directory or slice surface tag), then look up the corresponding row and column.

## Per-Surface Columns

| **Contract Library** | tdd-contract-first rule, implement-slice-setup |

## Surface Context Resolution

How each workflow determines which surface's row to read:

| Workflow Type | Resolution Method |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Spec-writing (`write-be-spec`, `write-fe-spec`) | Shard directory path: `.memory/wiki/specs/be/desktop/` → surface `desktop`; flat `.memory/wiki/specs/be/` → surface `shared` |
| Implementation (`implement-slice`) | Slice's `surface:` tag from the phase plan |
| Planning (`plan-phase`) | Iterates ALL surfaces in the map |
| Validation (`validate-phase`) | Runs per-surface commands for all surfaces |
| Cross-cutting (`verify-infrastructure`) | Uses cross-cutting table + primary surface for commands |
| Architecture (`create-prd-*`) | Map may be incomplete during these workflows — falls back to inline conversation context |
