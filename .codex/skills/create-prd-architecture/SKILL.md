## Overview


## Prerequisites

1. Stack decisions completed
2. Required map cells available for Hosting, ORMs, Databases

## Step-by-Step

### Step 0 — Map guard and context reload

1. Validate required map cells from `.codex/instructions/tech-stack.md`.
2. If any required cell is empty: stop and request map completion.
3. Read ideation context sources (index, constraints, global/domain CX, domain indexes or digest).
4. Resume/initialize checkpoint.

### Step 1 — System architecture section

Design and confirm:
1. Component diagram
2. Data flow lifecycle
3. Deployment topology
4. API surface
5. Deployment strategy
6. Surface interconnection (when multi-surface)
7. Shared domain boundary ownership

Write confirmed `## System Architecture` to `.memory/wiki/specs/architecture-draft.md` immediately.

### Step 2 — Error architecture section (hard gate)

1. Run error architecture interview.
2. Confirm all five required decisions.
3. Write `## Error Architecture` with five sub-sections and canonical envelope example.

### Step 3 — Data strategy section

1. Run data strategy interview using database/ORM skill guidance.
2. Define placement, schema approach, query patterns, migrations, PII boundaries.
3. For multi-surface: define ownership and sync protocol.
4. Run cross-store entity consistency pass.
5. Write confirmed `## Data Strategy` to architecture draft.

### Step 4 — Data placement document

Create `.memory/wiki/specs/data-placement-strategy.md` from template using locked data decisions.
