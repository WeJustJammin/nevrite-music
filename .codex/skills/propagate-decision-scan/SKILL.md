## Overview


## Step-by-Step

1. Pre-scan all supported decision types and count downstream references.
2. Present selection menu (or honor direct argument).
3. Run full scan on selected types; classify references as explicit contradiction / implicit assumption / consistent.
4. Write `.memory/wiki/specs/audits/propagation-scan-[date].md`.
5. Stop for user confirmation before apply shard.
